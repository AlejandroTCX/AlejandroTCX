## Hi, I'm Alejandro (aka OmegaShenron)

I'm a **Software Engineer** focused on building **production-ready, real-world platforms** using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

Over the past months, I've been deeply involved in designing and developing full systems — not just demos — with a strong emphasis on **architecture, reliability, and scalability**.

### What I'm currently building

- **Point of Sale (POS) system**  
  A complete POS built with modern web technologies, featuring **direct thermal ticket printing via QZ Tray**, working across browsers without relying on server-side print queues.  
  The system is designed for real retail usage, prioritizing speed, reliability, and offline-friendly behavior.

- **Attendance Checker Platform**  
  A custom attendance system connected to physical attendance devices through a background script that:
  - Continuously monitors for new check-ins
  - Processes data in real time
  - Automatically uploads records to the database as soon as a new entry is detected  

  This platform focuses on **automation, traceability, and real-time data synchronization**, removing manual steps entirely.

### Vision

I'm currently developing a broader platform planned for **market launch next year**, aiming to combine operational tools (sales, attendance, logistics, internal systems) into a cohesive and maintainable product.

The goal is not just to ship features, but to build:
- Clean and scalable architectures
- Systems that work reliably in real business environments
- Software that can grow without becoming fragile

### Collaboration

I'm always open to collaborating with engineers who:
- Work with **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- Have experience with frontend, backend, or full-stack development
- Enjoy building systems from scratch
- Care about code quality, performance, and long-term maintainability

If you know any **JavaScript-based stack** and want to collaborate, feel free to reach out.  
**One extra hand can make a big difference.**
